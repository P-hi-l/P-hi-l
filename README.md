Greetings visitor!

On this github profile, i will publish my coding excercises, and all the tutorials/courses i have done.
I highly appreciate your feedback and im constantly looking for ways to improve!

The main language i want to focus on is C#, since i have basic knowledge in that language (also basic C in microcontroller programming).
I think i sould also look at python at some point, but for now i have to decide for something!
I will try to keep my project ideas updated on this page
(if you have an excercise in mind that you would consider suitable for a beginner, feel free to propose it as a challenge to me!).

Currently im a PLC programmer by profession. PLC programming is quite different to real PC programming, thats why i want to expand my knowledge.

************************************************************************************************************************************************************
current projects:
    - As a first project im working on a console based adventure game, just to get used to the basics again. The scope of the project will be minimal(only
    a few 'open world' interactions, since i consider that just 'tedious' work from some point on. Features i will include are character creation, menu access,
    questlog, inventory, character stats. It will be published here when i consider it 'done'.

finished projects:
    - programmed a snake game for an atmega with i2c display. Have to find the Code again and upload. I would not consider this project well programmed!
